# Brain Tumor Detection

## ðŸ§  Project Overview
This project detects brain tumors from MRI images using machine learning. Users can upload MRI scans, and the system predicts whether a tumor is present. It is built using Python and deep learning techniques.

## ðŸš€ Features
- Detects brain tumors from MRI images
- User-friendly interface using Streamlit
- Pre-trained CNN model for accurate predictions

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure
- `app.py` â†’ Main application script
- `model.py` â†’ Machine learning model and training code
- `requirements.txt` â†’ List of required Python packages
- `Dataset for Brain tumor.zip` â†’ MRI images dataset
